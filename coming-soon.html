        <p>This page still needs some time in the oven before it can be released publically!</p><br>
        <p>Potabi is still in-beta software, and some things that we intend to have pages for on the welcome app might not exist. Including installation of the operating system itself - as that is still a work-in-progress. Other pages we need to absolutely make sure we do justice for, like why you should use our system - because we care about users, and we strongly care about our product (but we want to give a clear - and long - explanation of WHY we care). Some may simply not exist or are in such an incomplete state they are available but it's best to access them through other means for the time being.</p><br>
